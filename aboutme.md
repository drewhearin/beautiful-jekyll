## Short

I started this site because I wanted a repository for my thoughts and to hopefully improve my writing through outlining processes or problems I come across.  I don't really intend this site to get much traffic, or any at all really.  The term "blogger" really irks me, I view this more as a journal.

## Professionally

I work as an Information Systems Generalist for a non-profit healthcare organization at the moment. I enjoy working with data and I'm often writing lots of SQL stored procedures and developing reports,  or using Python, Powershell for automation in our windows environment.  I do wear many hats around our office.  As I keep updating this site I intend on getting more of my code up.

## Leisure

I enjoy cheesy 80s movies, good beer , film & tv

More to come!
