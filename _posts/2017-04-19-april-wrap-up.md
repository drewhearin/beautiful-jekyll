This is a small compilation of various forms of media that I've enjoyed this past month.

## Site(s)

[News Feed](https://newsfeed.one)

This site is great because it combines 3 sites I love: Hacker News, Google news and Reddit onto one neat page. It also contains a few subreddits (Ask Reddit, Men & Women, Ask Historians, TrueReddit, ELI5, Life Hacks and All).  The only thing that would make this site better is if you could choose which subreddits were displayed.

[TV Tropes](tvtropes.org)
I love TV and Movies and was happy to have found this gem not too long ago, and I warn you, the rabbit hole goes deep.  As stated by the wiki: TV Tropes is a wiki that collects and expands descriptions and examples on various conventions and devices (tropes) found within creative works.

## Book(s)

[The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/1452654123)

I'd seen a few people mention this book in the past and finally came around to picking it up.  This book is focused on Human-Centered design and how we interact with products given information that's out in the world (or not out in the world).  This is one of those books that I think everyone should read, It forces you to think critically about products you might use daily and how you interact with them.  It covers classic examples such as failing to figure out which liight switch to use or oven burner to turn on, whether to push, pull, or slide a door.  The fault, argues this book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology.  This isn't a full review as I'm about half way through as I write this, but very intriguing nonetheless.

## App(s) 

In the past year or so Product Hunt has become one of my favorite sites for discovering new apps, I would highly recommend it.

[Email This](https://www.emailthis.me/)

Email this is more or less a method of bookmarking.  What you do is 'install' it by adding it (a script) as a button to your toolbar & configure an email address.  When you come across a webpage you would like to save, simply click it and it will format the page neatly, remove unwanted distractions, and email you that final product.  I saw this early in the day and thought this was kind of cool, then later I ran into a situation where I actually wanted to use it.  I basically wanted to be able to automate this so it would send me a copy of a static site (a job page iwthout a built in reminder system) once a week to my email, so I can see if there's a position that may be a good fit.  Luckily I was able to get ahold of the developer who found the idea intriguing, and thinks he may be able to integrate it with IFTT or Zapier, hoping to hear back on that one.

[One Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall)

My tabs add up, it's just become a fact of life at this point.  At one point I was using The Great Suspender, which effectively kills a webpage after x amount of time, in order to save memory, however this just proved to be annoying after a while.  I've tried using other tab manager extensions in the past but none of them stuck.  I feel like I always want a more visual aspect to my tabs but One Tab has made me realize that's really not the case.  Install this extension, click it once and it closes out all of your tabs and loads it into one.  The single page has a simple list of each tab, that when clicked, goes away on this page.  It's clean and makes sense, and I'm going to see how well this pans out.
