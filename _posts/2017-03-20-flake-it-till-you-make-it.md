I have apparently been searching far too long for what's referred to as a static web page generator.  I spent the greater half of friday simply trying to edit locally, and push to git - all along running into permission errors, script problems with themes, oh the joy!  All I've wanted for a while was a simple minimalistic site where I can jot down my thoughts here and there (thank you git hub pages). I've seen them popup several times reading people's blogs on hackernews, but never have had any idea how to go about searching for how to create one.  Turns out there's many of these out there, mainly Jekyll, which is what this template was created for.  Suffice it to say - it's perfect for my needs.  I'm most certainly not a web developer, and I've used git in the past, however developing locally didn't really seem to make too much sense here, as I can just edit it right on the front end.
