subtitle: Forking was way easier than deploying with Hugo

I have apparently been searching far too long for what's referred to as a static web page generator.  I spent the greater half of friday simply trying to edit locally, and push to git from Hugo - all along running into permission errors, script problems with themes, oh the joy!  

Call me lazy, but forking the repo for the theme and simply redirecting my url to the Git Hub Pages custom url was just as sufficient.  Developing locally for text updates seemed a bit overkill, but all in all Git Hub pages combined with a static site theme seems to be perfect for my needs.
