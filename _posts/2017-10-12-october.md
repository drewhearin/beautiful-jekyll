A small compilation of various forms of media that I've enjoyed this past month.

## Books

[The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion](https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777)

I'm not the greatest reader, and by that I mean I usually have a few books going at a time, and have a hard time focusing on any given one, unless it unevuivocally captures my intersest.  That said,  this is the one that I'm trying to focus on lately.  I've only gotten about 60 pages or so into this book, but it's interesting.  The introductory chapters seem to focus on early psychological and sociological studies done in the 60s and 70s by developmental psychologists such as BF skinner, studying different psychosocial factors in different parts of the world; gathering how children and societies perceive questionable hypothetical actions and/or scenarios
