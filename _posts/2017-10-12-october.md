A small compilation of various forms of media that I've enjoyed this past month.

## Book

[The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion](https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777)

I'm not the greatest reader, and by that I mean I usually have a few books going at a time, and have a hard time focusing on any given one, unless it unequivocally captures my intersest.  That said,  this is the one that I'm trying to focus on lately.  I've only gotten about 60 pages or so into this book, but it's interesting.  The introductory chapters seem to focus on early psychological and sociological studies done in the 60s and 70s by developmental psychologists such as BF skinner, studying different psychosocial factors in different parts of the world; gathering how children and societies at whole perceive questionable hypothetical actions and scenarios that might been seen as 'normal' elsewhere.

## Productivity

[Todoist](https://todoist.com)
I've found myself using this more and more.  Just when I think I don't need to write something down I find myself adding it.  I could do this as a reminder or a note in my phone, but having everything in one place seems to be good for now.  We'll see how long I end up using it for!  There is something to be said for the (probably) tiny endorphin release you get from 'checking' something off a list, which is probably why I keep coming back.

[Day One](https://dayoneapp.com)
This is simply a simple journal app.  Granted I've only made one entry, on my computer at work.  I haven't ever been consistent in keeping a journal, so I'm skeptical about it.  I suppose time will tell.  The paid version lets you do entries via CLI which is pretty cool, but you also need the premium / subscription version (I believe) to have sync between devices.
